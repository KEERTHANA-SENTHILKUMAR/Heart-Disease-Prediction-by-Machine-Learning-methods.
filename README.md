# Heart-Disease-Prediction-by-Machine-Learning-methods.
In the heart disease prediction project, the heart.csv dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was utilized, comprising 303 records with 14 columns. Data preprocessing involved checking for null values using the info() method, which revealed no missing entries. Feature scaling was performed to standardize variables with different ranges, ensuring uniformity. The dataset was analyzed using a correlation matrix to understand attribute dependencies, and categorical features were converted into dummy variables for model compatibility.
Machine learning algorithms including SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost were employed. The dataset was split into an 80:20 ratio for training and testing. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices were used to assess model performance, with SVM achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.88%.
